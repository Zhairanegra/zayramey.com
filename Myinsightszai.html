		                   <p>Making HTML isn't a joke since it is very difficult. I've learned a lot from this lesson. It was difficult for me at first, since it analyzes everything, especially the fact that you are the one who will think what would be the design. There are also times that when I change or repeat codes, sometimes it worked, sometimes it doesn't. However, in spite of these challenges I faced, I have fun doing it, especially when you see that the codes you're putting in have finally worked and come to senses. I had also fun in inputting some images, adjusting webpage design, and experimenting some animations. Truly, after you worked it out and put a lot of effort, you'll find it enjoyful in the latter part. This lesson had an excellent feedback to me and I will never forget these experiences.</p>
